# TheEngine - A Lightweight Game Engine (Working Title)
This is a small, work-in-progress game engine, built entirely from scratch, designed to be minimalistic, lightweight and modular. It's currently in its early stages, and the name "TheEngine" is a working title that may change as the project evolves.


### ⚠️ Development Status Note: 
The engine is actively being developed on multiple feature branches, often experimenting with different architectural patterns in separate repositories before integration. As a result, progress can appear slow, but core architectural decisions are being rigorously tested for the `lightweight, modular` philosophy.
