## Predefined (at a high level): Many game engines or frameworks provide higher-level abstractions.

-Common Mesh Formats: The engine might have a set of predefined vertex formats 
 for common mesh types (e.g., PositionNormalUV, PositionNormalTangentUV, PositionColor). 
 When you import a model, the engine's asset pipeline might convert it to one of these predefined formats.

-Material System Integration: The material system might implicitly define the required vertex attributes
 based on the shader used by a material. If a shader expects POSITION and TEXCOORD0, the engine will ensure
 the bound mesh provides those.

-Editor Tools: If you're using an editor like Unity or Unreal, you typically don't 
 directly manipulate vertex layouts. You import models, and the engine handles the underlying
 GPU configuration based on its internal asset pipeline and rendering pipeline.
